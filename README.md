Concurrency: Doing more than one thing at a time

Multithreading: A form of concurrency that uses multiple threads of execution

As soon as you type new Thread(), it's over; your project already has legacy code.

Parallel Processing: Doing lots of work by dividing it up among multiple threads that run concurrently.

Asynchronous Programming: A form of concurrency that uses futures or callbacks to avoid unnecessary threads.

Reactive Programming: A form of concurrency that's a declarative style of programming where the application reacts to events.

			Imagine that you've been blindfolded and locked in the trunk of a car, then
			driven around for a while and dumped on a page somewhere deep in the bowels
			of a Web site. If the page is well designed, when your vision clears you should
			be able to answer these questions without hesitation:
			What site is this? (Site ID)
			What page am I on? (Page name)
			What are the major sections of this site? (Sections)
			What are my options at this level? (Local navigation)
			Where am I in the scheme of things? ("You are here" indicators)
