+----- For WPF APP -----+
expand reference title, descr section to support Adding of Sections (List of SectionViewModel)
consider factory pattern to resolve customizable section info, i.e., to support different UIs for different sections: Decorator, Singleton etc.

Next Up:
  Save or Display JSON data of model(s)

  Refactors/Renames:
    Consider including a Template Tab with generic controls and use when adding new References/Books
    ReferencesView/ReferencesViewModel => HeadFirstView/HeadFirst_ReferenceViewModel
  Correlate ViewModel.Sections (e.g., DecoratorViewModel, FactoryPatternViewModel) with ReferenceItemViewModelItem (e.g., Head First DP)
  
  Re-visit implemntations and refactor (e.g., use Factory Pattern to support adding and using a new Duck Type and or IFlyBehavior or IQuackBehavior dynamically in StrategyPattern UI)

+-- Strategy Pattern --+
  Refactor Model(s) (With idea to eventually to propogate to DB):
    Move DuckOrder and DuckOrderItem to WPF project
    DuckOrder => ViewModelDuckOrder
    DuckOrderItem => ItemViewModelDuck
    ItemViewModelDuck has a Model Duck (instead of string DuckType)


+-- PROMPTS --+
add a new section (which generates a new View + ViewModel, e.g., for Singleton pattern)

update ListBox on line 46 and ViewModelDecorator class add a button to remove Beverage from order

implement a view similar to DecoratorView to create an order for different types of ducks (see Duck.cs and ViewModelStrategyPattern.cs)

Add another section for Observer, following the pattern of ViewModelFactoryPattern which is paired with FactoryPatternView.xaml

implement an interface to update weather metics by calling SetMeasurements method in WeatherData and leveraging ViewModelWeatherConditions class from within ViewModelObserverPattern
