+----- For WPF APP -----+
expand reference title, descr section to support Adding of Sections (List of SectionViewModel)
consider factory pattern to resolve customizable section info, i.e., to support different UIs for different sections: Decorator, Singleton etc.

Next Up:
  Change Selected/Not Selected styling on Section buttons

  Refactors/Renames:
    Consider including a Template Tab with generic controls and use when adding new References/Books
    ReferencesView/ReferencesViewModel => HeadFirstView/HeadFirst_ReferenceViewModel
  Correlate ViewModel.Sections (e.g., DecoratorViewModel, FactoryPatternViewModel) with ReferenceItemViewModelItem (e.g., Head First DP)
  
  Re-visit implemntations and refactor (e.g., use Factory Pattern to support adding and using a new Duck Type and or IFlyBehavior or IQuackBehavior dynamically in StrategyPattern UI)

+-- Strategy Pattern --+
  Move DuckOrder and DuckOrderItem to WPF project
  DuckOrder => ViewModelDuckOrder
  DuckOrderItem => ItemViewModelDuck
  ItemViewModelDuck has a Model Duck (instead of string DuckType)


+-- PROMPTS --+
add a new section (which generates a new View + ViewModel, e.g., for Singleton pattern)

update ListBox on line 46 and ViewModelDecorator class add a button to remove Beverage from order

implement a view similar to DecoratorView to create an order for different types of ducks (see Duck.cs and ViewModelStrategyPattern.cs)

add another GroupBox for Edit Duck visible when SelectedDuck is not null that lets user change fly and quack behaviors via Duck methods: SetFlyBehavior, SetQuackBehavior
